# jsxstyle-loader

`jsxstyle-loader` is a webpack loader that extracts [**static style props**](#what-are-static-style-props) from jsxstyle components into a separate CSS file.

## Getting Started

Just three easy steps‚Ñ¢:

1. Add a new rule object for `jsxstyle-loader` to your webpack config.

2. Add a loader that handles `.css` files to your webpack config, because `jsxstyle-loader` adds a `.css` `require` to each component that uses jsxstyle.

3. Add `jsxstyle-loader`‚Äôs companion plugin to the `plugins` section of your webpack config.

When you‚Äôre done, the relevant parts of your webpack config should look like this:

```js
const JsxstyleLoaderPlugin = require('jsxstyle-loader/plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new JsxstyleLoaderPlugin(),
  ],
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ...
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: 'jsxstyle-loader',
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: 'your-cool-css-loader',
      },
      // ...
    ],
  },
};
```

## Loader Options

### `styleGroups`
By default, `jsxstyle-loader` will extract all static style props on a jsxstyle component into one class. This can lead to CSS classes that contain a lot of common style declarations. A good CSS minifier should help with this, but if you want a bit more control over how styles are grouped into CSS classes, you can provide an _array_ of CSS style objects. When `jsxstyle-loader` encounters a component that contains all styles in a style object, those styles will be extracted into a separate class name.

For example, with the following loader config:

```js
// ...
{
  loader: 'jsxstyle-loader',
  options: {
    styleGroups: [
      {
        display: 'block',
      },
      {
        marginLeft: 15,
        marginRight: 15,
      },
    ],
  },
}
// ...
```

...and a jsxstyle component that looks like this:

```js
import { Block } from 'jsxstyle';

<Block
  backgroundColor="blue"
  marginLeft={15}
  marginRight={15}
  padding={20}
/>;
```

...the styles on this component will be extracted into three separate classes:

```css
._x0 {
  display: block;
}
._x1 {
  margin-left: 15px;
  margin-right: 15px;
}
._x2 {
  background-color: blue;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Without the `styleGroups` parameter, all five extracted style props would be in one class.

### `namedStyleGroups`

The `namedStyleGroups` config option is just like the `styleGroups` config option, with one key difference: it is expected to be an _object_ of CSS style objects, not an array. The key of the CSS style object will be used as the class name if all props and values are present on a jsxstyle component.

### `whitelistedModules`

The `whitelistedModules` config option allows you to add modules to the evaluation context. For example, with the following loader config, any prop on a jsxstyle component that references a value from `./LayoutConstants.js` will be assumed to be evaluatable:

```js
// ...
{
  loader: 'jsxstyle-loader',
  options: {
    whitelistedModules: [
      require.resolve('./LayoutConstants'),
    ],
  },
}
// ...
```

### `parserPlugins`

`jsxstyle-loader` uses `babylon` to parse javascript into an AST. By default, `jsxstyle-loader` is preconfigured with most of `babylon`‚Äôs plugins enabled, but if you need to enable additional plugins, you can specify an array of plugins with the `parserPlugins` option.

You can see a list of all available plugins in [the `babylon` README][babylon 6 plugins].


## FAQs probably

### Can I use `jsxstyle-loader` with Flow?

Yes! Flow parsing is automatically enabled for any non-Typescript files.

### Can I use `jsxstyle-loader` with Typescript?

Yes! Typescript parsing is automatically enabled for `.ts` and `.tsx` files, but if you‚Äôre using a different file extension, you‚Äôll need to manually add `typescript` to the `parserPlugins` array.

### It‚Äôs not working üò©

1. Make sure the loader object `test` regex matches JS files that use jsxstyle.
2. `jsxstyle-loader` relies on JSX still being around, so make sure it runs *before* `babel-loader` does its thing.
3. `jsxstyle-loader` only supports destructured `require`/`import` syntax:
    ```jsx
    // Cool!
    import { Block } from 'jsxstyle';
    <Block />;

    // Neat!
    const { Block } = require('jsxstyle');
    <Block />;

    // Nope :(
    const Block = require('jsxstyle').Block;
    <Block />;
    ```

### What are ‚Äústatic style props‚Äù?

Simply put, static style props are props whose values can be evaluated at build time. By default, this consists of any literal type (`string`, `number`, `null`) as well as any variables provided to the evaluation context. The evaluation context is derived from the prop‚Äôs current scope.

For example, the `fontSize` prop in the following component will be marked as evaluatable and will be extracted as `42`:

```jsx
import { Block } from 'jsxstyle';

const bestNumber = 42;
<Block fontSize={bestNumber}>hello</Block>;
```

Any modules marked as whitelisted with the [`whitelistedModules`](#whitelistedmodules) config option will also be added to the evaluation context.

If the value of a style prop is a ternary and both sides can be evaluated, the prop will be extracted and the ternary condition will be moved to the `className`.

If the value of a prop is a simple logical expression with the `&&` operator, it will be converted to a ternary with a null alternate.

### Inline styles‚Ä¶ _are bad_.

See [the jsxstyle README](https://github.com/smyte/jsxstyle#faq).

### Does it work with hot reloading?

It sure does, but using it in development will only cause confusion, since what you will see in the developer tools is the _transformed_ JS. `jsxstyle-loader` is a _production_ optimisation.

### Any caveats?

One big one for now: CSS class names are not de-duplicated. It‚Äôs a feature I‚Äôd like to add before 1.0, but for now, I recommend using `postcss-loader` with the [`postcss-discard-duplicates`][discard dupes] plugin.

## :warning: Experimental :warning:

### jsxstyle lite

This is a smokey the bear ‚Äúleave no trace‚Äù type of deal right here. In your components, require from `jsxstyle/lite` instead of jsxstyle or `jsxstyle/lite/preact` instead of `jsxstyle/preact`. `jsxstyle-loader` will still extract every style it can, but dynamic styles will be ignored (with a warning) and all traces of runtime jsxstyle will be removed. WhoOOOoAoOA thAT‚Äôs CRAzyy.

### jsxstyle even lite-r

Close your eyes for a second and imagine with me‚Ä¶ imagine if you didn‚Äôt even have to require jsxstyle to use it. Just think‚Ä¶ all those dozens of characters you don‚Äôt have to type anymore.

Ok, now open your eyes and then lay them upon this piece of JSX:

```jsx
// look ma, no jsxstyle import
<block color="red">This text will be red</block>
```

Instead of importing components from jsxstyle or `jsxstyle/preact`, don‚Äôt import _anything_ and just use the dash-case version of the component name as if it‚Äôs a valid DOM element. When `jsxstyle-loader` encounters one of these dash-case elements, it‚Äôll treat it like the PascalCased equivalent component imported from `jsxstyle/lite`.

To enable this feature, pass an options object to `JsxstyleLoaderPlugin` with the `__experimental__extremelyLiteMode` key set to either `"react"` or `"preact"`.

### Stylesheet aggregation

By default, `jsxstyle-loader` adds one stylesheet for each component that uses jsxstyle. It‚Äôs nice for debugging and tends to work well for small to medium projects (i.e. < 100 components that use jsxstyle). However, if you‚Äôve got hundreds of components that use jsxstyle and you use `css-loader` on all those extracted stylesheets, you‚Äôll end up with hundreds of elements added to your document head on page load. Maybe that‚Äôs not your [style][pun-ishment]. Pass an object to `JsxstyleLoaderPlugin` with the `__experimental__combineCSS` set to `true` and `jsxstyle-loader` smash all those MF stylesheets into one megastylesheet.

Shhhh don‚Äôt tell anyone but it‚Äôll also rewrite relative `url()` paths to point to the right thing. ‚ÄúBut why would I want to use relative paths?‚Äù, you say. Well, combine an extracted stylesheet with `css-loader` and you‚Äôve got the full power of webpack `require()` in any CSS prop that uses a URL:

```jsx
<Block backgroundImage="url(!!cool-base64-loader!./path/to/an.svg)" />
```

Ideally this would only be a feature in `jsxstyle/lite` since the runtime version of jsxstyle (obviously) doesn‚Äôt support this feature. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs experimental.
